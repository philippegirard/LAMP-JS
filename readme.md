# Static Files

All files in the `/public` are served as static files. You can access them by going to `http://localhost:3000/public/<filename>`. For example, if you have a file called `hello.txt` in the `/public` folder, you can access it by going to `http://localhost:3000/public/stylesheets/style.css`.
